# SuperMeGmae

####This is a 2D platformer game built with HTML5 Canvas. The code uses JavaScript classes to define various game objects such as the player, platforms, and other background objects. The player is animated using sprite sheets, and the game implements gravity and platform collision detection.

#Code Structure
####The code starts with setting up the canvas and initializing its context.
####The Player class defines the player's attributes, such as speed, position, sprite sheets, and methods to draw and update the player on the canvas.
####The Platform and GenericObject classes define the platform and other background objects, respectively, with attributes like position, image, and width/height.
####The code sets up various images and objects, such as platforms, background, player sprite sheets, etc.
####There are event listeners to detect arrow key presses and update the player's velocity.
####The code implements a scrollOffset to provide a scrolling effect for the game.
#How to run the code
####You need to have a local development environment set up with a web server, or you can use services like CodePen or JSFiddle to run the code.
####The code assumes that the necessary images are in the img directory, and the paths to the images in the code should be updated if they are moved.
####The code requires a canvas element in the HTML file with the same id.

#Dependencies
####The code uses the HTML5 Canvas API and JavaScript.
####No external libraries or packages are required.
